    "The trigonometric and hyperbolic functions available in R are the cosine (cos()), the cosine for which the argument is multiplied by pi before the cosine is taken (cospi()), the sine (sin()), the sine for which the argument is multiplied by pi before the sine is taken (sinpi()), the tangent (tan()), the tangent for which the argument has been multiplied by pi before the tangent is taken (tanpi()), the inverse cosine (acos()), the inverse sine (asin()), two versions of the inverse tangent (atan() and atan2()), the hyperbolic cosine (cosh()), the hyperbolic sine (sinh()), the hyperbolic tangent (tanh()), the inverse hyperbolic cosine (acosh()), the inverse hyperbolic sine (asinh()), and the inverse hyperbolic tangent (atanh()).\n",

    "Angles are entered into the functions as radians (an angle in radians equals pi divided by 180 times the angle measured in degrees), except for cospi(), sinpi(), and tanpi(). For cospi(), sinpi(), and tanpi(), angles are entered as fractions of a circle times two (e.g., one is equivalent to 180 degrees, since 180 degrees is one-half of a circle). For the inverse functions, the angles are returned in radians. (Note that the result in degrees equals 180 divided by pi times the result that is returned in radians.) The argument(s) to the functions must be of the logical, integer, double, or complex type, except for cospi(), sinpi(), and tanpi(), which cannot be of the complex type. Values of the logical type are coerced to the integer type (see as.integer() in Chapter 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the inverse cosine and sine, the values must be between minus one and one, inclusive. For other values, the result is NaN. For the inverse tangent, atan() takes one argument (which can be any object or expression of the logical, integer, double, or complex type), and the result falls between minus pi divided by two (-π/2, which is equivalently -90°) and pi divided by two (π/2, which is equivalently 90°).\n",
    "\n",
    "The atan2() function takes two arguments. The function returns the inverse tangent of the ratio of the two arguments, with the first argument being the numerator and the second the denominator. Both arguments of the function take any object or expression of the logical, integer, double, or complex type (logical values are coerced to the integer type). The arguments can be of different lengths and will cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tangent of x, for any number x, is the sine of x divided by the cosine of x. Since the function atan2() finds the angles associated with numbers in both a numerator and a denominator, the angles can fall in any quadrant, rather than just between minus pi divided by two and pi divided by two (between -90° and 90°). It follows that the function returns angular results between minus pi (-π, or equivalently -180°) and pi (π, or equivalently 180°).\n",
    "\n",
    "The quadrant of the angle depends on the signs on the arguments for the numerator and the denominator. (The quadrants start at the positive x axis and take up 90 degrees of arc. The quadrant number increases in the counterclockwise direction.) For the sign combinations, +/+ puts the angle in the first quadrant (0 to π/2), +/– puts the angle in the second quadrant (π/2 to π), –/– puts the angle in the third quadrant (-π to -π/2), and –/+ puts the angle in the fourth quadrant (-π/2 to 0). Also, zero in the denominator returns pi divided by two (π/2, or equivalently 90°) or minus pi divided by two (–π/2, or equivalently -90°), depending on the sign of the numerator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyperbolic functions can also take any object or expression of the logical, integer, double, or complex type (logical values are coerced to the integer type). For the inverse of the hyperbolic functions, any values in the argument for acosh() must be between one and plus infinity, inclusive; the argument of asinh() can be any object or expression of the logical, integer, double, or complex type; and the values in the argument of atanh() must be between minus one and one, inclusive. For acosh() and atanh(), illegal values return NaN and a warning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguments to the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions can be vectors, matrices, data frames, or arrays. For arguments with more than one element, the operation is carried out elementwise. For atan2(), which takes two arguments, the arguments cycle. The functions return an object of the same dimension(s) as the argument(s) to the function.\n",

    "There are two exponential functions in the base package: exp() and expm1(). There are five logarithmic functions: log(), logb(), log10(), log2(), and log1p().\n",
    "\n",
    "The exp() function returns the value of Euler’s number (i.e., e) raised to the power of the argument of the function (i.e., ex). The expm1() function returns Euler’s number raised to the value of the argument, from which quantity one is subtracted (i.e., ex − 1). The expm1() function is useful for data where the smallest value is zero (e.g., count data). The exponential functions can find the result for any value of the logical, integer, double, or complex type (logical values are coerced to the integer type).\n",
    "\n",
    "The log() and logb() functions return the logarithms of the values in the first argument of the function. The base for the logarithm is set by the second argument. For both functions, the default base is Euler’s number (i.e., the functions return natural logarithms by default). The log() function is an S4 generic function as well as an S3 function. The logb() function is just an S3 function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the log10() and log2() functions, the base of the logarithm is ten and two, respectively (i.e., log10(x) is the value for which 10log10(x) is x and log2(x) is the value for which 2log2(x) is x). The preceding four functions find logarithms for nonnegative values of the integer or double type and for any values of the complex or logical type (logical values are coerced to the integer type). The legal types for the second argument are the same as the legal types for the first argument. The first and second arguments need not be the same length and will cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The log1p() function returns the logarithm of values to which one has been added (i.e., log(x + 1)). Like the expm1() function, log1p() is useful for data where the smallest value is zero. The first argument of the function takes values of the logical, integer, or double type (logical values are coerced to the integer type). The integer and double values must be greater than or equal to minus one (i.e., ≥ − 1). The second argument takes the same types of values as in the log() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value returned for the log of zero, one, or Inf varies with the value of the base. For the two functions for which the base can be assigned, the log of zero returns -Inf for all bases except zero and Inf. For zero or Inf, taking the log of zero returns NaN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the log of one returns zero for all bases except when the base is set to one. For one, taking the log of one returns NaN.\n",
    "\n",
    "The log of Inf returns -Inf when the base is set to legal values less than one (i.e., 0 ≤ base < 1) and Inf for values of base greater than or equal to one, except when the value of base is Inf (i.e., when 1 ≤ base < Inf). When the base is set equal to Inf, the function returns NaN. All other legal values for the two arguments give results other than NaN.\n",

    "## Beta and Gamma Related Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions related to the beta and gamma functions are beta(), lbeta(), gamma(), lgamma(), psigamma(), bigamma(), trigamma(), choose(), lchoose(), factorial(), and lfactorial(). In R, these functions are called the Special functions. The arguments to these functions must be of the logical, integer, or double type (logical values are coerced to the integer type). The function returns a result with the same dimensions as the argument. The elements of the arguments cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beta() and lbeta() functions take the a and b arguments and return the value of the beta function or the natural logarithm of the value of the beta function, respectively. Both a and b must be nonnegative. Negative numbers return NaN, with a warning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gamma(), lgamma(), psigamma(), digamma(), and trigamma() functions take the x argument and, for psigamma(), the deriv argument. The x argument can be any number except zero or the negative integers (for which NaNs are returned with a warning). The gamma() and lgamma() functions return the value of the gamma function and the natural logarithm of the absolute value of the gamma function, respectively. The psigamma() function returns the derivative of the natural logarithm of the gamma function to the order given by deriv. The deriv argument must be set to an integer greater than or equal to zero. Otherwise, NaNs are returned, with a warning. By default, deriv equals zero. The digamma() function returns the value of the first derivative of the natural logarithm of the gamma function, while trigamma() returns the second derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choose() and lchoose() functions return binomial coefficients and the natural logarithms of the absolute values of binomial coefficients, respectively. The choose() function is the familiar “n choose k” if n is a positive integer and k is a nonnegative integer less than or equal to n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both functions take the n and k arguments. The n argument can be any object or expression of the logical, integer, or double type (logical values are coerced to the integer type). The k argument can be any object or expression of the logical, integer, or double type (logical values are coerced to the integer type and double-precision values are rounded to integers). The arguments need not be the same length and cycle out to the longer argument. If k contains numbers that are negative when rounded, the function returns 0 for the numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The factorial() and lfactorial() functions return the factorial value and the natural logarithm of the absolute value of the factorial value, respectively. The factorial of a number is defined as gamma(x+1) for any value of x that is a real number. For x a positive integer, the factorial equals x factorial (i.e., (x)(x-1)(x-2)...(2)(1), denoted by x!).\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions take one argument, x. The value of x can be any object or expression of the logical, integer, or double type (logical values are coerced to the integer type). For x equal to zero, factorial(x) equals one. Negative integers return NaNs with a warning.\n",

    "A few other functions that are often useful are:\n",
    "\n",
    "__R.home(), R.Version(), dir(), getwd(), setwd(), system(), all.equal(), Identical(), unique(), duplicated(), (and anyDuplicated()), rle(), (and inverse.rle()), jitter(), pretty(), cut(), rev(), hexamode(), margin.table(), prop.table(), try(), warning(), suppressWarnings(), warnings(), stop() and gc()__.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the functions, we will just describe what they do. You can find more information about the functions by using the Help tab in RStudio or by entering ?function.name at the R prompt, where function.name is the name of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the function descriptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- R.home() gives the full path to the directory containing the R program.\n",
    "- R.Version() gives the R version and other information about the version.\n",
    "- dir() returns the contents of a directory on the hard drive.\n",
    "- getwd() returns the computer directory (folder) in which R is operating.\n",
    "- setwd() sets the default computer directory (folder) in which R reads and saves files.\n",
    "- system() runs a system command from inside R (the command is entered in quotes).\n",
    "- all.equal() tests if two objects are nearly equal.\n",
    "- Identical() tests if two objects are identically equal.\n",
    "- unique() returns a vector with any duplicated elements in the original vector removed. The function only works on vectors, including vectors of the list type.\n",
    "- duplicated() and anyDuplicated() look for duplicates. For vectors, including lists, duplicated() returns a vector of the same length containing FALSE for elements that are not duplicated and for the first instance of elements that are duplicated. The function returns TRUE for the rest of the duplicates. For matrices and data frames, rows are compared. The function anyDuplicated() counts how many differing elements have duplicates, or duplicated rows for matrices and data frames.\n",
    "- rle() (and inverse.rle()) returns the value and number of times the value is repeated (consecutively) in a vector, or reverses the process.\n",
    "- jitter() adds a little jitter (noise) to the elements of numeric objects. The arguments to jitter() control how much jitter is added.\n",
    "- pretty() takes any object that can be coerced to numeric and returns a vector of evenly spaced values close to a given length and similar to the values in the original object.\n",
    "- cut() cuts a numeric vector into factors and returns a factor vector with the factor names in the place of the original elements. The object to be cut can be any object that can be coerced to vector but must be numeric. The break points and factor names can be assigned, but cut() creates break points and factor names from the break points by default.\n",
    "- rev() reverses the order of the elements of an object and returns a vector. The object can be atomic or any type where reversing the order makes sense, like the list, expression, and call types.\n",
    "- hexmode() returns the hexadecimal value of a number.\n",
    "- margin.table() takes a logical, numeric, or complex object and returns margin sums for a margin in a table.\n",
    "- prop.table() takes a logical, numeric, or complex object and returns the object divided by the sum of the elements in the object. Logical objects are coerced to numeric, and the real and imaginary parts of complex objects are treated separately.\n",
    "- try() attempts to execute an expression or function and returns an error message or the result of the execution. Errors do not stop the program.\n",
    "- warning() generates warning messages from within an expression or function.\n",
    "- warnings() returns the warning messages if a program has run with warnings.\n",
    "- suppressWarnings() suppresses warnings generated by an expression.\n",
    "- suppressMessages() suppresses messages generated by an expression\n",
    "- stop() tells R to stop the execution of a function. If stop() has a character string for an argument, the character string prints when stop() executes. The function is very useful for the process of debugging a function as well as for checking if conditions are met for objects entered into a function.\n",
    "- gc() garbage collection—cleans up the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other functions in the base package, many of which have to do with the running of R. The as. and is. functions are prevalent. On the help page for the base package, there are 53 links for as. functions and 43 links for is. functions. The Bessel functions and bitwise logical functions are also part of the base package.\n",
