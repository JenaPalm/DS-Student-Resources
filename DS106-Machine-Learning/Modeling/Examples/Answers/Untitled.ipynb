    "A retailer wants to create a simulation to predict the profit on the sales of a certain tool she carries.  She knows the profit is a function of several factors, for which she has historical data: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Units Sold:** Normal distribution, with a mean of 26 units and a standard deviation of 5.7 units.\n",
    "* **Price:** Discrete distribution. 55% of the time the price is 38 dollars, 30% of the time the price is 41.50 dollars, and 15% of the time is 36.25 dollars.\n",
    "* **Cost:** Uniform distribution, with a max of 33.72 dollars and a min of 26.88 dollars.\n",
    "* **Resource Factor:** Normal distribution, with a mean of 3 and a standard deviation of 1.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function for profit is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Profit = (RF * (Units sold) * (Price)) - ((0.2) * (RF) * (Units sold) * (Cost)) + $320```\n",

    "Create a simulation that has 100 rows of monthly profits. Once you have completed this simulation exercise, prepare a report stating what you did, what you learned, and your results. You have the option to complete your simulation in either R, Python or Excel.  Then submit it for grading."
