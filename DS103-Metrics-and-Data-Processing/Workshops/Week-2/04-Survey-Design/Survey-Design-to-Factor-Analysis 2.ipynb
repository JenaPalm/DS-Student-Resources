    "Like anything else even somewhat creative, it pays to not rush in blindly, but rather to spend some time thinking through requirements and figuring about your overall goals. Here are the general steps in survey development:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine the overall purpose of the survey\n",
    "- Brainstorm the questions you are trying to answer with the survey\n",
    "- Create survey items that align with your questions\n",
    "- Format the survey as appropriate for your questions and your audience\n",
    "- Write scoring and administration rules if needed\n",
    "- Test out your survey\n",
    "- Administer your survey"
