topic: AWS Regions
```
## AWS Regions

AWS has the concept of a Region, which is a physical location around the world where we cluster data centers. We call each group of logical data centers an Availability Zone. Each AWS Region consists of multiple, isolated, and physically separate AZs within a geographic area. Unlike other cloud providers, who often define a region as a single data center, the multiple AZ design of every AWS Region offers advantages for customers. Each AZ has independent power, cooling, and physical security and is connected via redundant, ultra-low-latency networks. AWS customers focused on high availability can design their applications to run in multiple AZs to achieve even greater fault-tolerance. AWS infrastructure Regions meet the highest levels of security, compliance, and data protection.

AWS provides a more extensive global footprint than any other cloud provider, and to support its global footprint and ensure customers are served across the world, AWS opens new Regions rapidly. AWS maintains multiple geographic Regions, including Regions in North America, South America, Europe, China, Asia Pacific, South Africa, and the Middle East.

- An AWS Region is a geographical area.
    - Data Replication across Regions is controlled by you.
    - Communication between Regions uses AWS backbone network infrastructure.


- Each Region provides full redundancy and connectivity to the network.
- A Region typically consists of two or more Availability Zones

```

## AWS GovCloud (US)

AWS GovCloud (US) gives government customers and their partners the flexibility to architect secure cloud solutions that comply with the FedRAMP High baseline; the DOJâ€™s Criminal Justice Information Systems (CJIS) Security Policy; U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR); Export Administration Regulations (EAR); Department of Defense (DoD) Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide (SRG) for Impact Levels 2, 4 and 5; FIPS 140-2; IRS-1075; and other compliance regimes.

AWS GovCloud (US-East) and (US-West) Regions are operated by employees who are U.S. citizens on U.S. soil. AWS GovCloud (US) is only accessible to U.S. entities and root account holders who pass a screening process. Customers must confirm that they will only use a U.S. person (green card holder or citizen as defined by the U.S. Department of State) to manage and access root account keys to these regions.

From Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), Personally Identifiable Information (PII), sensitive patient medical records, and financial data to law enforcement data, export controlled data and other forms of CUI, AWS GovCloud (US) Regions can help customers address compliance at every stage of their cloud journey.

```c-lms
topic: AWS Availability Zones 
```

## AWS Availability Zones

An Availability Zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region. AZs give customers the ability to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than would be possible from a single data center. All AZs in an AWS Region are interconnected with high-bandwidth, low-latency networking, over fully redundant, dedicated metro fiber providing high-throughput, low-latency networking between AZs. All traffic between AZs is encrypted. The network performance is sufficient to accomplish synchronous replication between AZs. AZs make partitioning applications for high availability easy. If an application is partitioned across AZs, companies are better isolated and protected from issues such as power outages, lightning strikes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and more. AZs are physically separated by a meaningful distance, many kilometers, from any other AZ, although all are within 100 km (60 miles) of each other.

- Each Region has multiple [Availability Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/)
- Each AZ is a fully isolated partition of the AWS Infrastructure.
    - There are over 80 AZs
    - AZs consist of discrete data centers
    - They are designed for fault isolation
    - They are interconnected with other AZs by using high-speed private networking
    - You choose AZs
    - AWS recommends replicating data and resources across AZs for resiliency

</p>

AWS pioneered cloud computing in 2006, creating cloud infrastructure that allows you to securely build and innovate faster. We are continuously innovating the design and systems of our data centers to protect them from man-made and natural risks. AWS team implement controls, build automated systems, and undergo third-party audits to confirm security and compliance. As a result, the most highly-regulated organizations in the world trust AWS every day. Take a virtual tour of one of their data centers to learn about our security approach to protect the data of millions of active monthly customers.

- AWS data centers are designed for security
- Data centers are where data resides and data processing occurs
- Each data center has redundant power, networking and connectivity and is housed in a separate facility
- A data center typically has 50-80 thousand physical servers

- For example you can control can terminate EC2 instances or delete S3 buckets
- You can define fine-grain access rights
    - who can access the resource
    - which resources can be accessed
    - what can a user do with the resource
    - how resources can be accessed
- IAM is a no-cost account service

## IAM essential components

<p style="text-align: left">
  <img  src="Media/IAM-User.png" width="100" alt="AWS IAM">
</p>

A person or application that can authenticate with an AWS account.

<p style="text-align: left">
  <img  src="Media/IAM-Group.png" width="100" alt="AWS IAM">
</p>

A collection of IAM users that are granted identical authorization.

<p style="text-align: left">
  <img  src="Media/IAM-Policy.png" width="100" alt="AWS IAM">
</p>

The document that defines which resources can be accessed and the level of access to each resource.

<p style="text-align: left">
  <img  src="Media/IAM-Role.png" width="100" alt="AWS IAM">
</p>

Useful mechanism to grant a set of permissions for making AWS service requests.

---

When you define an IAM user, you select what types of access the user is permitted to use.

- Programmatic Access
    - Authenticate using:
        - Access key ID
        - Secret access key
    - Provide AWS CLI and SDK access

- AWS Management Console Access
    - Authenticate using:
        - 12-digit account ID
        - IAM username and password
    - If enabled, multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompt for an authentication code.

<p style="text-align: center">
  <img  src="Media/IAM-MFA.png" width="600" alt="AWS IAM">
</p>

---

After an AWS User is connected to their account, what are they allowed to do and access?

<p style="text-align: center">
  <img  src="Media/IAM-Allowed.png" width="600" alt="AWS IAM">
</p>

---

## IAM Authorizations

- Assign permissions by creating an IAM Policy.
- Permissions determine which resources and operations are allowed.
    - All permissions are implicitly denied by default.
    - If something is explicitly denied, it is never allowed.

Best practice: Follow the **principle of least priviledge**

Note: the scope of IAM service configurations are global. Settings apply across all AWS Regions.

---

## IAM Policies

- An IAM Policy is a document that defines permissions
    - Enables fine-grain access control
- Two types of policies - Identity-based and Resource-based
    - Identity-based policies
        - Attach a policy to any IAM entity
            - IAM User, IAM Group, IAM Policy
        - Policies specify:
            - Actions that may be performed by the entity
            - Actions that may not be peformed by the entity
        - A single policy can be attached to multiple entities
        - A single entity can have multiple policies attached to it
    - Resource-based policies
        - Attached to a resources such as an S3 bucket

</p>


How an IAM determines positions:

<p style="text-align: center">
  <img  src="Media/IAM-Determines-Permissions.png" width="600" alt="AWS IAM">
</p>

---

## IAM Groups

- An IAM Group is a collection of IAM Users
- A group is used to grant the same permissions to multiple users
    - Permissions granted by attaching IAM policy or policies to the group
- A user can belong to multiple groups
- There is no default group
- Groups cannot be nested

<p style="text-align: center">
  <img  src="Media/IAM-Groups.png" width="400" alt="AWS IAM">
</p>

---

## IAM Roles

- An IAM Role is a specific IAM identity with specific permissions
- Similar to an IAM user
    - attach permission policies to it
- Different from an IAM user
    - Not uniquely associated with one person
    - Intended to be assumable by a person, application, or service
- Role provides temporary security credentials
- Examples of how IAM roles are used to delegate access
    - Used by the IAM user in the same AWS account as the role
    - Used by an AWS service such as Amazon EC2 in the same account as the role
    - Used by the IAM user in a different AWS account than the role

Scenario:

- An application that runs on an EC2 instance needs access to an S3 bucket

Solution:

- Define an IAM policy that grants access to the S3 bucket
- Attach the policy to a role
- Allow EC2 instance to assume the role

</p>

- AWS Organizations enables you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts so that you centrally manage them.

- Security features of AWS Organizations:
    - Group AWS accounts into organizational units (OUs) and attached different access policies to each OU.
    - Integration and support for IAM
        - Permissions to a user at the intersection what is allowed by AWS Organizations and what is granted by IAM in that account.
    - User service control policies to establish control over the AWS services and API actions  that actions that each AWS account can access.

- Service control policies (SCPs) offer centralized control over accounts.
    - Limit permissions that are available in an account that is part of an organization.
- Ensures that accounts comply with access control guidelines
- SCPs are similar to IAM permissions policies:
    - They use similar syntax.
    - However, SCP never grants permissions.
    - Instead, SCPs specify the maximum permissions for an organization.

topic: Securing Data on AWS
```

## Encryption of data at rest

- Encryption encodes data with a secret key, which makes it unreadable.
    - Only those with the secret key can decode the data.
    - AWS KMS can manage your secret keys
- AWS supports encrypted data at rest
    - Data at rest = Data stored physically (On disk or tape)
    - You can encrypt data stored in any service that is supported by AWS KMS, including:
        - Amazon S3
        - Amazon EBS
        - Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)
        - Amazon RDS managed databases 

## Encryption of data in transit

- Encryption of data in transit (data moving across a network)
    - Transport Layer Security (TLS), formerly SSL, is an open standard protocol.
    - AWS Certificate Manager provides a way to manage, deploy, and renew TLS or SSL certificates
- Secure HTTP(HTTPS) creates a secure tunnel
    - Uses TLS or SSL for secure bidirectional exchange of data
- AWS services support data in transit encryption
    - Two examples show below:
    
<p style="text-align: center">
  <img  src="Media/AWS-Data-Transit-Encryption.png" width="600" alt="AWS IAM">
