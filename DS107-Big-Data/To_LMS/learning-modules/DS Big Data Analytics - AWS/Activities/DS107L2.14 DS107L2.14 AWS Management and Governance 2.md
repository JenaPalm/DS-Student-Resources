What do you gain from setting up consolidated billing for five different AWS accounts under another master account?
- **Each AWS account gets volume discounts**
  - AWS consolidated billing enables an organization to consolidate payments for multiple AWS accounts within a single organization by making a single paying account. For billing purposes, AWS treats all the accounts on the consolidated bill as one account. Some services, such as Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 have volume pricing tiers across certain usage dimensions that give the user lower prices when they use the service more. For example, if you use 50 TB in each account you would normally be charged $23*50*3 (because they are 3 different accounts), But with consolidated billing you would be charged $23*50+$22*50*2 (because they are treated as one account) which means that you would save $100.
- AWS servicesâ€™ costs will be reduced to half the original price
- Each AWS account gets five times the free-tier services capacity
- The consolidated billing feature is just for organizational purposes
