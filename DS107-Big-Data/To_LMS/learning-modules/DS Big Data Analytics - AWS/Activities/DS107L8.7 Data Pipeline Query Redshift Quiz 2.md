To work with data in your Amazon Redshift cluster, you need ____________________ for connectivity from your client computer or instance.
- AWS Data Pipeline
- **Amazon Redshift JDBC, ODBC, or Python drivers**
- AWS Data Pipeline SDK
- AWS Data Pipeline Query API

To connect to your Amazon Redshift cluster with your SQL client tool, you need the cluster connection string. You can find the cluster connection string in the
- AWS Data Pipeline
- Amazon Redshift JDBC, ODBC, or Python drivers
- **Amazon Redshift console, on a cluster's details page.**
- AWS Data Pipeline Query API

To connect to your Amazon Redshift cluster with your SQL client tool, you need the cluster connection string. You can find the cluster connection string in the Amazon Redshift console, on a cluster's details page. The cluster connection string is in the following format:
- jdbc:redshift://<clustername>.<region>.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439/dev
- conn = redshift_connector.connect(host='cluster.abc.us-west--redshift.amazonaws.com',database='dev',user='awsuser',password='my_password')
- Driver={Amazon Redshift (x64)}; Server=cluster.abc.us-west--redshift.amazonaws.com; Database=dev; UID=adminuser; PWD=my_password; Port=5439
- **all the above**

To query databases hosted by your Amazon Redshift cluster you can use the following tools:
