Project ____________ exists to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages.
- **Jupyter**
- Saturn
- Venus
- Mars

The Jupyter project is comprised of several projects: 
- Jupyter Notebook: The Classic Notebook Interface. 
- JupyterLab : A Next-Generation Notebook Interface. 
- JupyterHub: JupyterHub brings the power of notebooks to groups of users. 
- Voilà helps communicate insights by transforming notebooks into secure, stand-alone web applications that you can customize and share.
- **All the above**

Jupyter Notebook provides a browser-based REPL built upon a number of popular open-source libraries including:
- Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
- MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node
- MongoDb, Express, Angular, React
- **IPython, ØMQ, Tornado, jQuery, Bootstrap, MathJax**

True or False? The Jupyter notebook extends the console-based approach to interactive computing in a qualitatively new direction, providing a web-based application suitable for capturing the whole computation process: developing, documenting, and executing code, as well as communicating the results. The Jupyter notebook combines two components: - A web application: a browser-based tool for interactive authoring of documents which combine explanatory text, mathematics, computations and their rich media output. - Notebook documents: a representation of all content visible in the web application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects.
- **True**
- False

True or False? The Jupyter notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.
- **True**
- False

Jupyter notebooks may be exported to a range of static formats, including:
- Python
- R
- C++
- **HTML, Text, LaTeX, PDF, markdown, reStructuredText, and more**

True or False? JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter. It enables users to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.
- **True**
- False

Which AWS service allows you to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models for any use case with fully managed infrastructure, tools, and workflows?
- **Amazon SageMaker**
- Amazon EC2
- Amazon S3
- Amazon RDS

True or False? Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that enables developers and data scientists to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models at any scale.
- **True**
- False

Amazon SageMaker is based which open source project?
- **Jupyter**
- Saturn
- Venus
- Mars

______________________ eliminates the heavy lifting of building ML models. You simply provide a tabular dataset and select the target column to predict, and ______________________ will automatically explore different solutions to find the best model.
- **Amazon SageMaker Autopilot**
- Amazon EC2
- Amazon S3
- Amazon RDS

____________________________ expands access to machine learning (ML) by providing business analysts with a visual point-and-click interface that allows them to generate accurate ML predictions on their own — without requiring any machine learning experience or having to write a single line of code.
- Amazon Data Pipeline
- Amazon EC2
- Amazon S3
- **Amazon SageMaker Canvas**

_____________________ provides machine learning developers with greater visibility into their training data and models so they can identify and limit bias and explain predictions.
- Amazon Data Pipeline
- Amazon EC2
- Amazon S3
- **Amazon SageMaker Clarify**

With _______________________, you can simplify the process of data preparation and feature engineering, and complete each step of the data preparation workflow, including data selection, cleansing, exploration, and visualization from a single visual interface. 
- Amazon Data Pipeline
- Amazon EC2
- Amazon S3
- **Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler**


_____________ is a Python library for creating interactive visualizations for modern web browsers. It helps you build beautiful graphics, ranging from simple plots to complex dashboards with streaming datasets. 
- **Bokeh**
- Sandstorm
- Kalidescope
- Glitter
