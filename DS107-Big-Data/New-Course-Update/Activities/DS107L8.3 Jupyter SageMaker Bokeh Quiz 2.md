Project ____________ exists to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages.
1. **Jupyter**
2. Saturn
3. Venus
4. Mars

The Jupyter project is comprised of several projects: 
1. Jupyter Notebook: The Classic Notebook Interface. 
2. JupyterLab : A Next-Generation Notebook Interface. 
3. JupyterHub: JupyterHub brings the power of notebooks to groups of users. 
4. Voilà helps communicate insights by transforming notebooks into secure, stand-alone web applications that you can customize and share.
5. **All the above**

Jupyter Notebook provides a browser-based REPL built upon a number of popular open-source libraries including:
1. Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
2. MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node
3. MongoDb, Express, Angular, React
4. **IPython, ØMQ, Tornado, jQuery, Bootstrap, MathJax**

True or False? The Jupyter notebook extends the console-based approach to interactive computing in a qualitatively new direction, providing a web-based application suitable for capturing the whole computation process: developing, documenting, and executing code, as well as communicating the results. The Jupyter notebook combines two components: 1. A web application: a browser-based tool for interactive authoring of documents which combine explanatory text, mathematics, computations and their rich media output. 2. Notebook documents: a representation of all content visible in the web application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects.
1. **True**
2. False

True or False? The Jupyter notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.
1. **True**
2. False

Jupyter notebooks may be exported to a range of static formats, including:
1. Python
2. R
3. C++
4. **HTML, Text, LaTeX, PDF, markdown, reStructuredText, and more**

True or False? JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter. It enables users to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.
1. **True**
2. False

Which AWS service allows you to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models for any use case with fully managed infrastructure, tools, and workflows?
1. **Amazon SageMaker**
2. Amazon EC2
3. Amazon S3
4. Amazon RDS

True or False? Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that enables developers and data scientists to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models at any scale.
1. **True**
2. False

Amazon SageMaker is based which open source project?
1. **Jupyter**
2. Saturn
3. Venus
4. Mars

______________________ eliminates the heavy lifting of building ML models. You simply provide a tabular dataset and select the target column to predict, and ______________________ will automatically explore different solutions to find the best model.
1. **Amazon SageMaker Autopilot**
2. Amazon EC2
3. Amazon S3
4. Amazon RDS

____________________________ expands access to machine learning (ML) by providing business analysts with a visual point-and-click interface that allows them to generate accurate ML predictions on their own — without requiring any machine learning experience or having to write a single line of code.
1. Amazon Data Pipeline
2. Amazon EC2
3. Amazon S3
4. **Amazon SageMaker Canvas**

_____________________ provides machine learning developers with greater visibility into their training data and models so they can identify and limit bias and explain predictions.
1. Amazon Data Pipeline
2. Amazon EC2
3. Amazon S3
4. **Amazon SageMaker Clarify**

With _______________________, you can simplify the process of data preparation and feature engineering, and complete each step of the data preparation workflow, including data selection, cleansing, exploration, and visualization from a single visual interface. 
1. Amazon Data Pipeline
2. Amazon EC2
3. Amazon S3
4. **Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler**


_____________ is a Python library for creating interactive visualizations for modern web browsers. It helps you build beautiful graphics, ranging from simple plots to complex dashboards with streaming datasets. 
1. **Bokeh**
2. Sandstorm
3. Kalidescope
4. Glitter
