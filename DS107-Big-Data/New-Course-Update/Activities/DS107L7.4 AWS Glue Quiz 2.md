________________ is a serverless data integration service that makes it easy for analytics users to discover, prepare, move, and integrate data from multiple sources. You can use it for analytics, machine learning, and application development. It also includes additional productivity and data ops tooling for authoring, running jobs, and implementing business workflows. 
1. **AWS Glue**
2. AWS Athena
3. AWS EMR
4. AWS Redshift

You can doing several things with AWS Glue: You can run ETL jobs as new data arrives; you can catalog your data to quickly discover and search multiple AWS datasets without moving the data; you can use no-code ETL jobs which makes it easier to visually create, run, and monitor ETL jobs; you can explore and experiment with data directly from your data lake. All using tools such as:
1. **AWS Glue Studio and AWS Glue DataBrew**
2. AWS Athena and AWS EMR
3. AWS Glue Data Catalog
4. AWS Glue ETL

True of False? With AWS Glue, you can search and query cataloged data using Amazon Athena, Amazon EMR, and Amazon Redshift Spectrum.
1. **True**
