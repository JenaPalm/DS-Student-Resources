What does the "Principle of Least Privilege" refer to?
- All IAM users should have at least the necessary permissions to access the core AWS services
- IAM users should not be granted any permissions; to keep your account safe
- All trusted IAM users should have access to any AWS service in the respective AWS account
- **You should grant your users only the permissions they need when they need them and nothing more**
    * The principle of least privilege is one of the most important security practices and it means granting users the required permissions to perform the tasks entrusted to them and nothing more. The security administrator determines what tasks users need to perform and then attaches the policies that allow them to perform only those tasks. You should start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions when necessary. Doing so is more secure than starting with permissions that are too lenient and then trying to tighten them down.

Which of the following must an IAM user provide to interact with AWS services using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)?

An organization has many technical employees who operate their AWS Cloud infrastructure. What does AWS provide to help organize them into teams and then assign the appropriate permissions for each team?
- **IAM Groups**
    * An IAM group is a collection of IAM users that are managed as a unit. Groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users. For example, you could have a group called Admins and give that group the types of permissions that administrators typically need. Any user in that group automatically has the permissions that are assigned to the group. If a new user joins your organization and needs administrator privileges, you can assign the appropriate permissions by adding the user to that group. Similarly, if a person changes jobs in your organization, instead of editing that user's permissions, you can remove him or her from the old groups and add him or her to the appropriate new groups.
