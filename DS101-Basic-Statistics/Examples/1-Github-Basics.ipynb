    "- What is the difference between branching and forking?\n",
    "\n",
    "ref: [Differencebetween.net](http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-fork-and-branch/#:~:text=Branching%20is%20to%20create%20another,without%20affecting%20the%20main%20repository.)\n",
    "answer: Branching is to create another line of development in the project without affecting the main branch or repository. Forking, on the other hand, is to make a clone of the repository on your GitHub account without affecting the main repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "ref: [Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-branch-and-a-fork-on-GitHub)\n",
    "A branch of a GitHub repository can be local to your PC or remote in GitHub. If you want to work on a specific feature on a repository, you branch out separately, work on that branch and then commit it to GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you branch out in your PC, it is a local branch. The branch itself needs to be committed along with the changes in it. The merge then happens from remote branch to the master branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "You raise a pull request to get the changes from the remote branch merged into the master branch. The owner of the master branch will accept your pull request and merge your changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fork (unlike branching) is a GitHub to GitHub operation. When you fork a repository, it’s a clone of the entire repository within GitHub with all of its branches. Typically you do a fork if you want to use the current repository as a base to work on a new project or make changes to show differences between the current repository and the new one in large open source projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forking creates a clone of the entire repository in your GitHub account and branches can be created from this repository as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pull requests are raised from a fork as well if it needs to be merged into a destination repository.\n",
    "\n",

    "Below is a reference from [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/the-definitive-guide-to-forks-and-branches-in-git)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Let's talk about Open Source Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Open source patterns don’t always make the most sense for business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their goals are a bit different: open source favors experimentation, where business tends to want focus in order to reduce time to market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural choices tend to mirror these goals. And the decision to use a forks or branches to work on features can have an appreciable impact a team’s overall productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forking tends to empower a divergent evolution of the codebase, which makes it ideal for an environment that’s looking to empower broad experimentation on a theme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Branching, on the other hand, caters toward convergent evolution. This tends to be a better fit for private repositories, and why it is commonly used by enterprise companies and in most business contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Divergent development vs. Convergent development\n",
    "\n",
    "In the open source world, it’s very common for a codebase, once reaching a certain point, to split into two distinct projects, each with a different goal (though still a shared ancestry).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most canonical example is the Linux codebase. Today, Linux has many forks (i.e RedHat), all stemming from a shared historical baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s important to note is that these flavors aren’t just temporary development paths — they are codebases with distinct ‘identities,’ with no intention of re-integration with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches, on the other hand, are always intended to be ‘convergent’ development paths. Branches are ephemeral by their very nature: a branch is really nothing more than a pointer at the head of a commit lineage. Both this pointer and the branch are eventually destroyed and purged from the Git history after the branch is merged into origin/master.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Forking creates an entirely new repository\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub popularized “forking” with a convenient button. When you make a fork, you are duplicating the entire repository and its history up until that point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forking creates a new repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Clicking the fork button in GitHub, or any other host that allows for forking, completes a git clone command and creates a new origin/master.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forks are best used: when the intent of the ‘split’ is to create a logically independent project, which may never reunite with its parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the open source world, this happens all the time. A team sees a codebase that could be a good starting point for their project, and they have no intention of trying to merge this back into the root codebase. So they use a fork as a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Branching\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches are more commonly used to act like ‘construction zones’ in a codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches are best used: when they are created as temporary places to work through a feature, with the intent to merge the branch with the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most branches are short lived; once a feature is merged into origin/master the branch is deleted. Some branches are long-lived, i.e. Staging, still have the intent to converge with origin/master.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a branch, use git checkout -b new-branch which creates a new branch from the origin of your current repository. Changes can still occur on while you are working on your new-branch."
