By contrast, the >> operator will append the output to the specified file. The input operator (<) will redirect data as an input to whatever is called before the operator. The pipe operator (|) is used to send the output of one command to another command so that you can carry out an operation on the results of the first command."

    "find can be input/output intensive, which can sap system resources, especially if you run a search that will scan a large amount of candidate files. In fact, the search above is exactly that kind of search, since it is looking for filenames starting from the root directory. It will check every single file on the entire system to see if it is a match. The locate command instead queries a database to avoid being too I/O intensive.\n",

The database that locate uses to optimize the search process is updated once per day by default, so that means if you are trying to locate a newly created file it will not be present in the database.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Step 4\n",
    "Searching for text within files and outputs\n",
    "find is great if you are looking for criteria about a file, but if you instead want to locate specific file contents, the grep command is what you need. To illustrate this, search for the words you added to the messages log file. The command below uses the -r option to search recursively from the starting directory (/var/log). This will return all locations in any file residing in a subdirectory of /var/log that contain the string \"Hello World\".\n",

    "\n",
    "The output shows the line you added using logger earlier in this lab. If you do not specify a search location in the grep command, it will default to your current directory. Additionally, the string being searched for is case-sensitive by default. If you want a case-insensitive search, add the -i option.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "grep -ir \"hello world\" /var/log\n",
    "\n",
    "/var/log/messages:Jul 16 21:38:22 be3f7e9f7264 root[24468]: Hello World\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This option can save you from believing that a string does not exist if you weren't sure about how it was capitalized in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you may want to see a few more lines before or after the result of your search. This is done using the context option (-C). This option allows you to specify a number of lines before and after the result of the search to display.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "grep -C1 fact quote.txt\n",
    "```\n",

    "The fact that it is just a small part of something larger\n",

    "\n",
    "NOTE: If you wish to only display lines after the result, use -A (context after). For lines before the result, use -B (context before).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to leverage grep is by piping the output of another command into grep using the | operator. This saves you effort if you are just looking for a specific word or phrase in a lengthy output. You will get a chance to try this out in step 6 of this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5\n",
    "Using df to check disk usage\n",
    "A large part of a system administrator's job is to be able to diagnose what is causing a system to misbehave. Disk space being full can lead to unexpected behavior, so the df command is great to include in any troubleshooting session.\n",
    "\n",
    "The df command, short for \"disk free\", shows a breakdown of disk usage. The -h option will present the sizes in a human readable format:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "df -h\n",

    "Filesystem             Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The usage percentage (Use%) column is a great place to start. If any filesystem is close to capacity, then it may be unable to perform installations or other operations that require data to be written. However, the absolute size of the partition will determine what \"close to capacity\" means. In the case of this system, the root partition is 35 GiB. Therefore, even if it is at 80% usage, the filesystem will still have 7 GiB to work with. Probably something you need to address eventually, but unless you are doing some storage-intensive operation that is failing, likely not the cause of immediate issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boot partition is on the other end of the spectrum, with a size of only 1014 MiB. Therefore, if this filesystem is at 80% usage, there will only be 200 MiB available. That may not be enough for basic operations such as installing system updates. Therefore, it is very concerning if you run df and discover one of the smaller filesystems is at 80% usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The tmpfs entries are filesystems accessible by the machine that are stored in RAM. This means that you don't have to care as much about these filesystems when troubleshooting using df. A reboot will give you a fresh copy of these filesystems.\n",

    "Just as files organize how data is stored on Linux, processes organize all of the programs that are running on the system. The ps command (short for Process Status) will display information about the processes running in the current shell.
